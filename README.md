# Sketch Color Palette
Sketch Color Palette for Sketch Libraries or Automation of Tint and Shading Colors.

SASS/SCSS file is included but the colors are expected to be entered as HEX, RGB or HSL values for each variable. I've attempted to automate a portion of this with SASS/SCSS functions but none of the available once are able to reproduce the exact HEX, RGB or HSL values from the Sketch document. If anyone has any recommendations towards a SASS/SCSS function that can do this please share via the Github Issues.
